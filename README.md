# LILAGames_Test_Submit

01/03/2022 

- Updated

We know that the period of finishing the Test was until friday, and we deliver it as it was at that time. 
  Evendo do we didnt finish it yet, we did a small update for cleaning unused scripts and test scenes.

*  Updated Scene Statement1a 

   - Board Size can be selected on BoardData GameObject  ( it is not creating a correct number of tiles on the board yet )
   
  
*  Deleted Scene Stament1

  -  Due to the performance target, we deleted the scene statemnt1 where its aproach using UI GameObjects was too expensive compared using Tilemap component.
  
  
  
We Still need to add :

 for statement1 :
            
            * Data management and storage function
            * Correct the boardsize creation
            * Add randomly color and display
            * Add Area of interest function
            * Incorporate Zoon functionality for cases of big boards where the tiles become too small (?)
